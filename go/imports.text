problem : 

imports dose not recognize by vscode 


solution : 
Check your GOPATH and GO111MODULE settings:

    Ensure that your GOPATH environment variable is correctly set. It should point to the directory where your Go projects are located.
    If you're using Go modules (GO111MODULE=on), ensure that your project is located outside of GOPATH and that you have initialized Go modules in your project directory.
